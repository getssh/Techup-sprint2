# Welcome to Sprint 2 !

In this sprint, you will be tasked with implementing some core utility functions for our Applicant Tracking System.

## Topics
- Algorithms, Data structures
- Problem-solving
- Core Javascript
- Unit testing (with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) )

## Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and npm need to be installed.
- You can use your prefered IDE, or use Github workspaces to work on your project.



## Getting started ðŸš€

- Create a clone of this project
- Install dependencies
```bash
  npm install
```
- Run the unit tests

```bash
 npm run test
```
You will see that most tests will have failed. Your goal is to complete the challenges so that, by the end of the sprint, all tests will pass.

- The `model.js` file contains implementations of the model classes that we will be using. It's important to carefully examine these classes before attempting the challenges.
- The `challenges/` folder contains the different challenges to complete during this sprint. 

## Challenges

- **Challenge 2.1**: complete the functions in the challenge.2.1.js file. All unit tests must pass, and your solutions should be as optimal as possible.

- **Challenge 2.2**: complete the functions in the challenge.2.2.js file. All unit tests must pass, and your solutions should be as optimal as possible.

- **Challenge 2.3**: complete the functions in the challenge.2.3.js file. All unit tests must pass, and your solutions should be as optimal as possible.

- **Challenge 2.4**: complete the functions in the challenge.2.4.js file. All unit tests must pass, and your solutions should be as optimal as possible.

- **Challenge 2.5**: Examine the coverage report displayed when you run `npm run test`. The challenge is to create additional unit tests to improve your test coverage.
